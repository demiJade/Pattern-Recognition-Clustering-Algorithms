I have made a JS program that will do KNN for me.

To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Select the training data set in csv format with the names of the feature vectors in the first row and append the word "end" after the last column in the first row.
3. Select the validation data set in the same format as the training data set.
4. The data that was fed into the program can be viewed from console. Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + i to do so.
5. Input K.
6. Click Go!
7. The results text area will show the real category and the tested category of the data point in the experiment in JSON format.
8. The validation data text area will show the validation data points that were used and the list of their K nearest neighbors.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for other values of K.

For K-means, the spreadsheet in the Midterms excel file will start iterating when "control" is a blank cell. 
To configure the settings for iterations, click on "Files", go to "Options", select "Formulas", and check the "Enable Iterations". Set Max iterations to 1.
To start over, type anything or "stop" in the blank yellow cell then delete it. 
Press F9 to iterate.
